I am Abderrahim Alakouche, originally from Morocco 🇲🇦 and residing in Stockholm, Sweden 🇸🇪 at the moment.

I like to build things with Python, Docker, SQL and NoSQL databases, DL/ML, and modern backend APIs.
I enjoy challenging myself and nurturing my creativity by constantly seeking to learn new things.

Next to coding 👨‍💻, I love chess ♟️, anime, callisthenics 🏋️ and coffee ☕!
